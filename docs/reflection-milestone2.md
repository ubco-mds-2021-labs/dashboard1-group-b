## Work Achieved

We have tried to accomplish things as presented in our layout. However, it is an initial stage of getting the dashboard practically builds up; there are certain elements of the presented layout which have been modified as required. All the plots required by the team have been made. The plots are interactive using the dropdowns. All the plots and the dropdowns have been perfectly made function as we required from them. The positions of the plots have been modified to give a dashboard a better view. We have incorporated most of the useful information we have planned to present to our viewer.

## Work not yet achieved

Currently, the plots would interact using dropdown for the room selection and the date selection but later on we will change the interaction through the floor plan image as presented in our layout. There would be some changes in relation to the layout and the plot with regards to the principles of visualization. A piece that we have not yet worked on is the proper presentation/beautification of our dashboard. 

## Not Functional Components

Every component is dynamic as per the selection made by the user.

## Positive Reflections 

The plots are interactive as we wanted them to be. The presented information seems to be perfectly aligned to convey our message. The segmentation of the plots is well achieved as per the importance of message that viewer should focus on while doing the visualization.

## Negative Reflections 

We think that the colours are not appropriate. More interactions need to be added.

## Future Scope of improvement

Since we have crossed the first stage of our structuring the dashboard, we could now get our floor plan image come in as a master piece and present more information to the view in a concise manner. We could like to avoid the viewer`s pain to search and select from the dropdown by helping him to hover on the particular floor and conveniently select the room they are interested in to seek the details.
